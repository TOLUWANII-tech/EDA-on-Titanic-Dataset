# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis on a data set using Python's numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib libraries.


This is a project that performs basic Exploratory Data Analysis on the 'Titanic' Dataset.

The dataset presents a binary classification problem. The Logistic Regression algorithm was used to build a model to predict whether or not a passenger survived based on the features in the data.

Python's data science libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn were used throughout the project.

Many visual plots were used using the seaborn and pandas libraries, alongside matplotlib's pyplot module. These helped to show the correlation between the features in the dataset and also highlight key trends and focal points in the data. For instance, it was discovered that relatively, a higher percetage of women than men survived. Also, more passengers in higher classes survived.

Several of seaborn's methods were used for graphing with appropriate arguments to bring out these insights.

In developing a model to predict the binary target of the data (whether a passenger survived or not), data cleaning had to performed for missing data. The data was split into training and test sets, the algorithm was instantiated, the model was fitted based on the training set and predictions were made based on the test set.

The accuracy score of the model was as well computed, and a classification matrix was used as well in analysing the nature of the model's performance/
